Chat application using nodejs and socket.io

- To create chat application we should have have communication between various clients.

- We will use socket.io to establish connection between server and the client.

- Then communication will take place between two clients via server

- A socket is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the network. The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between which the communication take place.

- Socket are generally employed in client server applications. The server creates a socket, attaches it to a network port addresses then waits for the client to contact it. The client creates a socket and then attempts to connect to the server socket. When the connection is established, transfer of data takes place.
